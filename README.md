# 📱 FirstApp

Welcome to **FirstApp**, my very first Android app! 🎉 This is a practice project where I’m exploring the basics of Android development, including how to change colors, modify text, and implement simple interactions.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning

This project is all about:
- **Understanding Android Studio**: Getting familiar with the interface, layout editors, and tools.
- **UI Basics**: Learning how to manipulate UI elements such as text, buttons, and colors.
- **Event Handling**: Implementing simple event listeners to respond to user interactions like button clicks.
- **XML and Java/Kotlin**: Writing code in XML for layouts and Java for backend logic.

## 🔧 Features
- **Color Changes**: Experimenting with how to dynamically change the color of UI elements like backgrounds and text.
- **Text Updates**: Implementing simple functionality to update the text displayed on the screen.

## 🚀 Future Plans
As I continue to learn Android development, I plan to expand this app with more features, including:
- More complex interactions (e.g., user input)
- Navigation between multiple screens
- Basic animations and design enhancements

## 📝 Conclusion
FirstApp is just the beginning of my Android development journey, and while it’s simple, it marks a major milestone for me as I step into the world of mobile app development. Stay tuned for more as I continue to learn and grow!
